# Tic Tac Toe Game in React.js

This is a simple, yet engaging, implementation of the classic game of Tic Tac Toe, built using React.js.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- NPM (comes bundled with Node.js) or Yarn

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/MoeJaafar/Tic-Tac-Toe-game-js-react.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```
    cd Tic-Tac-Toe-game-js-react
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    or if you prefer using Yarn:
    ```
    yarn install
    ```
4. Start the development server:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    or with Yarn:

    ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

Now, you should be able to play the game!

## How to Play

Click on any cell in the grid to make a move. The game alternates between 'X' and 'O'. The game ends when one player has three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or when all cells on the grid are filled, in which case the game is a draw.

The game can be reset at any time by clicking the refresh icon.
